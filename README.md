[Link to project euler #8](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8)

Solved in C++
**NOTE** this is solved using 5 consecutive digits 
As of 08/06/2014 the site has problem #8 with 4 and 13 consecutive digits.

The large number is read in from a text file and written to a **vector** for processing.
>Alhough an easy alternative could be hard coding the number into an array.
>I just liked how cleaner the code looked without the big chunk of numbers.
